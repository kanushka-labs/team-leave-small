# High-level architecture

Derive the design tree from `requirements.md`. The design lives under
`specs/design/` — never at the bundle root.

```
specs/design/design.cell                      # project-level architecture diagram DSL (this skill) — emit FIRST
specs/design/design.md                        # the top-level design (this skill)
specs/design/components/<name>/design.json    # one per component (structured facts)
specs/design/components/<name>/wireframes.dsl  # web-applications only (excalidraw-wireframes skill)
specs/design/components/<name>/openapi.yaml   # services only (openapi-conventions skill) — emit LAST
```

## The architecture diagram — design.cell

`specs/design/design.cell` is a single project-level file holding the
cell-diagram DSL. Emit it **FIRST**, before design.md and the component
design.json files: it is small, it fixes the component decomposition up front,
and the console streams it into the live architecture diagram as you write, so
the user watches the architecture take shape.

**Load the `cell-architecture-dsl` skill before writing design.cell.** It
carries the full grammar, the AEP boundary semantics (own components inside the
cell; Thunder auth and org services on east; third-party SaaS on south;
internet/intranet exposure on north/west), and the single-`addFile` write
protocol. Do not guess the syntax — `resource`/`external` are NOT keywords, and
the node `type` is a bare trailing token with no colon.

**design.cell is the architecture contract.** The rest of the design must match
it: every `components/<name>/design.json` uses the SAME component id as its
`design.cell` node, and every edge in design.cell that touches a component
appears as a `dependencies[]` entry on that component's design.json (and vice
versa — an interaction in design.json must be an edge in design.cell). A
mismatch between the two is a defect, not a stylistic choice.

## Incremental architecture changes

When a later change alters the ARCHITECTURE of an existing design — a component
added/removed/renamed, an edge or exposure changed, an external/SaaS dependency
added or dropped — keep the generation order: update
`specs/design/design.cell` FIRST (load `cell-architecture-dsl`; targeted
editFile edits, or removeFile + ONE addFile only for a restructure), then the
design.md Components/Interactions sections, then every affected component's
design.json. design.cell stays the architecture contract after every change,
not just the first one. A change that alters none of those leaves design.cell
untouched.

## The top-level design.md

These sections, in order. Depth rule: **every requirement must have a home** in
a capability, entity, role, or screen below — a requirement you can't point to
in this document is a defect, not an editing choice.

1. **Overview** — what the system is, in one paragraph.
2. **Components** — a bullet per component: name, `type`, one-line
   responsibility.
3. **Capabilities** — per component, the exhaustive feature list the
   requirements imply, each with 1–2 sentences of responsibility. Group by
   module when the requirements do (e.g. "Risk register", "Audit evidence").
   This list drives the component's API resources and screens — anything
   missing here silently disappears downstream.
4. **Data model** — the core entities, their key fields, and relationships.
   These become the API's `components/schemas`.
5. **Roles & access** — the actors from the requirements and what each may
   see/do. Drives auth design and per-role screens.
6. **Interactions** — who calls whom and for what: component-to-component
   plus external integrations (email, AI/LLM, object storage, ...).
7. **Data flow** — the main lifecycles end to end (one numbered walkthrough
   per core workflow).

Do NOT add platform-owned boilerplate: no Kubernetes/monitoring/backup
sections, no generic performance targets, no "future enhancements" — unless
the requirements state them.

After emitting or changing a component's design, record the skills that
component's build actually needs as a `skillsApplied` array **inside that
component's `specs/design/components/<name>/design.json`** — e.g. a Go API
service → `["openapi-conventions", "go"]`; a web-application →
`["excalidraw", "react"]`. It is a JSON key on the component's design object,
so include it when you write that `design.json` (addFile/editFile) — do NOT
put `skillsApplied` in `design.md` frontmatter. Each component carries only the
skills its own build needs.

## Deriving components — deployment units the requirements justify

A component is one independently deployable unit, NOT a domain concept. The
right number comes from the requirements: for every component you must be
able to say "this deploys and evolves independently because <something the
requirements state>". Write that justification into the component's
`description`.

A requirement justifies a SEPARATE component when it shows:

- a distinct user-facing surface — e.g. an internal admin portal AND a
  customer-facing app with different users and lifecycles → two web-applications;
- a genuinely different runtime or scaling profile — e.g. an async
  worker/batch processor beside an interactive API, or a long-running
  AI/inference service;
- a technology the rest of the system doesn't share — e.g. a Python ML
  service beside a Go API;
- an explicitly separate lifecycle or ownership stated in the requirements.

Do NOT split by:

- entity or domain concept — claims-service, users-service,
  receipts-service... is a domain model dressed as a topology; those are
  modules of ONE service;
- layer — auth, notifications, file storage as own services when they are
  modules of the API;
- infrastructure — api-gateway, database, queue, auth server are NEVER
  components; the platform provides them.

When nothing above forces a split, a small system naturally lands at one
service + one web-application — that is an outcome of the rule, not a target. Name
components in kebab-case after their responsibility (`expense-api`,
`expense-webapp`, `report-worker`).

**Component `type` is a fixed vocabulary — use the EXACT string.** A backend is
`"service"`; a browser app is `"web-application"` (OpenChoreo's own term). Write
`"web-application"` verbatim — NOT `"webapp"`, `"web-app"`, or `"webApplication"`
(those are rejected, and a wrong value silently breaks the app's deployment and
runtime config). The `-webapp` in a component NAME is fine; the `type` is still
`"web-application"`. Other kinds the requirements imply (`"scheduled-task"`,
`"worker"`, …) are captured verbatim.

## Per-component design.json

Each component's structured facts live in ONE JSON document (no markdown, no
frontmatter). The platform validates each write against this schema and rejects
violations:

```json
{
  "name": "expense-api",              // MUST equal the directory name
  "type": "service",                  // EXACT kind: "service" or "web-application" (NEVER "webapp"/"web-app"), or another the requirements imply ("scheduled-task", "worker", ...)
  "version": "0.1.0",                 // semantic version; 0.1.0 for a new component
  "language": "Go",                   // implementation language, e.g. "Go", "TypeScript"
  "buildpack": "docker",              // always "docker"
  "appPath": "expense-api",           // repo-relative source dir — the component name
  "entrypoint": "deployment/service", // deploy entry
  "exposure": "internet",             // "internet" (public) | "intranet" (internal only)
  "dependencies": [ /* see below — every arrow in Interactions appears here */ ],
  "description": "One paragraph: single responsibility, port/entrypoint expectations, and what it explicitly does NOT do.",
  "endpoint": { "name": "http" } // optional; see below
}
```

`name`, `type`, `version`, `language`, `buildpack`, `appPath`, `entrypoint`,
`exposure`, `description`, and `dependencies` are required. To CHANGE a
design.json, re-emit the whole corrected file (removeFile + addFile) — never
patch JSON with anchored edits. On INVALID_JSON or SCHEMA_VIOLATION, fix what
the message lists and re-emit.

`endpoint` is optional: omit it and a service's endpoint takes the default name
`"http"`. Declare `{ "name": "<endpoint-name>" }` only when the endpoint must be
named otherwise — `name` is the single source of truth the coding agent copies
into `workload.yaml` and the managed-API gateway binds to. The port lives in
`workload.yaml`, not here.

Do NOT author `exposesAPI`, `componentAgentInstructions`, or any dependency
`status`/`reason` — those are PLATFORM-owned. If the platform has already
written them into the file, preserve them verbatim.

### dependencies — the unified dependency edges

`dependencies` mirrors the Interactions section of the top-level design.md:
every arrow there appears here and vice versa — a mismatch is a defect. Each
entry has a `kind` (which selects the meaningful fields) and a `name`; pick the
kind by WHAT the target is:

- **`component`** — a SIBLING component in this same design that THIS component
  CALLS: a directed caller→callee edge (one Interactions arrow). Declare it ONLY
  on the caller, naming the callee it invokes:
  `{ "kind": "component", "name": "expense-api" }`. Never add the reverse edge —
  a web-app depends on the API it calls; the API does NOT depend on the web-app
  that calls it. If a component isn't actually called by this one, it is not a
  dependency of it (do not list it "for reference").
- **`org-service`** — a service owned by ANOTHER project in the org that
  publishes its endpoint for cross-project use. Its `name` is the provider's
  EXACT component name from `list_org_endpoints`, copied verbatim — a name you
  LOOK UP, never one you coin. The requirement (and any org skill) names the
  service by ROLE ("the organization's directory service", "the notification
  service"); that role is NOT the name, and the provider is usually named
  differently — the "directory service" may be `employee-service`, the
  "notification service" `email-service`. Call `list_org_endpoints`, pick the
  row that fills the role, copy its `name`:
  `{ "kind": "org-service", "name": "<name from list_org_endpoints>" }`. A name
  coined from the role words matches no provider and hard-fails the build.
- **`external`** — a system OUTSIDE the platform (a SaaS API, a legacy
  service). Two shapes:
  - *SDK-style SaaS* (Stripe, SendGrid, ...): no spec needed — the component
    codes against the vendor SDK. Declare only the `config` keys it reads.
  - *REST-with-spec*: when the component must call specific endpoints, set
    `"needsSpec": true`. Point `specPath` at a stored contract
    (`dependencies/<name>.openapi.yaml`) or give `specUrl` for the platform to
    fetch. A `needsSpec` external with no spec yet is left UNRESOLVED for the
    user to supply — that is expected, not an error to fix.
- **`platform-resource`** — a backing resource the platform provisions (a
  database, cache, object store). Set `resourceType` to a registered type and
  `parameters` for provisioning:
  `{ "kind": "platform-resource", "name": "orders-db", "resourceType": "postgres", "parameters": { "size": "small" } }`.
  `thunder-app` is the platform's auth resource type: when the spec implies
  users sign in, declare it on BOTH the SPA and each protected service, using
  the SAME dependency `name`. For `thunder-app` ONLY, proposing the `scopes`
  parameter value is allowed (default `openid profile email`); every other
  resource type keeps the no-invented-parameters rule. Never propose
  `redirectUris` — they are platform-managed. See the `thunder-authentication`
  skill for the full rule.

```json
"dependencies": [
  { "kind": "component", "name": "expense-api" },
  { "kind": "platform-resource", "name": "orders-db", "resourceType": "postgres" },
  { "kind": "external", "name": "stripe",
    "config": [ { "key": "STRIPE_API_KEY", "secret": true, "description": "Your Stripe secret API key" } ] },
  { "kind": "external", "name": "legacy-billing", "needsSpec": true,
    "specUrl": "https://billing.example.com/openapi.yaml" }
]
```

**Discover before you invent.** The platform MCP tools are the source of truth
for every dependency's name and shape — call them before authoring an
`external`, `org-service`, or `platform-resource` dependency, and take the name
and schema from what they return, not from the requirement's wording:

- `list_external_resources` / `get_external_resource_schema` — reuse an
  already-registered external resource by its EXACT `name` and `config` schema
  rather than inventing a parallel one.
- `list_org_endpoints` — the org-service catalog every `org-service` `name` is
  copied from verbatim (see the `org-service` kind above). When no row fills the
  role the requirement describes, leave the dependency unresolved rather than
  coining a name — a name that resolves to nothing is worse than an absent one.
- `list_org_component_endpoints` — once you have the provider's name, call this
  to read its REAL contract before writing the dependency's `description`:
  each row resolves to a `spec.availability` of `inline` (read
  `spec.inlineContent` directly — it IS the OpenAPI document), `repo` (no
  inline spec, but the row's `owner`/`repo`/`subdir`/`branch` locate the
  provider's source — use `search_remote_git_code` under that `subdir` to find
  the spec file if you don't know its exact path, then
  `get_remote_git_file_contents` to read it), or `none` (no contract is
  resolvable). Base the dependency's `description` on the ACTUAL
  operations/paths/schemas the contract exposes; on `none`, say so plainly in
  the `description` instead of inventing a shape.
- `list_platform_resource_types` — get a valid `resourceType` (and its
  parameters) before declaring a `platform-resource`. Read each type's
  `description` and pick the type whose description matches the need; when
  none matches, leave the dependency unresolved rather than forcing a fit.

**Config-key conventions.** `config` is the env-var schema the consuming
component codes against. Use `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` keys. `secret` is opt-in:
set `"secret": true` ONLY for credentials (they route through the secret path);
OMIT it entirely for plain config — a key with no `secret` field is non-secret.
Give each key an optional `description` — a short note on what the value is and
where the user finds it (e.g. `{ "key": "STRIPE_API_KEY", "secret": true,
"description": "Your Stripe secret API key" }`); the Build dependency drawer
shows it under the field. For a NON-secret key whose sensible default you can
infer (a region, a base URL), add an optional `defaultValue` — the drawer
pre-fills the field with it (e.g. `{ "key": "AWS_REGION", "defaultValue":
"us-east-1" }`). NEVER set `defaultValue` for a secret (`"secret": true`) — a
credential like an API key has no default to invent. Keep the keys minimal —
only what the component reads.

**`needsSpec` is opt-in.** Omit `needsSpec` entirely unless the dependency needs
a collected OpenAPI spec, in which case set it `true` (never write `false`).

**Resolution status is platform-computed.** A dependency's `status` (resolved /
ambiguous / unresolved / blocked) and its `reason` are computed by the platform
at read time against the live catalog — you never author those. Declare the
intent (kind + name + fields above) and let the platform resolve it. An
`external` dependency should almost always carry at least one `config` key — the
value-collection gate needs something to collect.

Every dependency carries a one-line `description`: what the target is and how
the component uses it (for an `external`, which endpoints/SDK and auth scheme;
for an `org-service`, the specific operations/paths it calls from the
provider's discovered contract — or that no contract was resolvable, never a
guess; for a `platform-resource`, what it stores). The console shows it in the
dependency drawer and the coding agent relies on it to integrate correctly.

One component per directory. Every `web-application` gets a `wireframes.dsl`
(load `excalidraw-wireframes` before writing it); every `service` gets an
`openapi.yaml` (load `openapi-conventions` before writing it), emitted LAST. Other
kinds (scheduled tasks, workers, ...) carry no extra artifact yet — capture
their behavior fully in `description` and `dependencies`.
